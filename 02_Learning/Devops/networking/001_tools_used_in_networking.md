# Modem
A modem is a electrical device which converts **digital signal to analog signal and analog signal to digital signal** vise versa. It is used to send the digital data produced by the computer to the internet via any type of transportation such as telephone lines to the receiving modem which will therefore convert the analog signal to another digitala singal which can be read by the other computer.

So basically by modem computers can communicate with each other via **wired or guided** forms of communication.

# Router
This is a device which reoutes the data packets to other networks or devices based on theri desired op packets. It binds the packets with the ip address and sends those to the network which can be therefore received by devices with those particular ip.
**A router serves as a bridge for one network to communicate with an outside network/device.**

# Switch
A network bridging device that uses destination addresses to forward packets of data. A switch will have the MAC address of all the devices connected to its ports and forwads the given packet to the port of the matching destination address.
